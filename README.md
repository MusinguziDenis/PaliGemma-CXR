## PaliGemma-CXR
This is the official code base for PaliGemma-CXR: a multitask multimodal model for chest X-ray interpretation

In this project, we finetuned PaliGemma a foundational vision language model for disease detection, Report Generation, VQA, Object Detection and Segmentation.
The model that was jointly trained on all the tasks outperformed the task-specific models.
